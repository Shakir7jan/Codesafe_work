Product Requirements Document (PRD) for AI-Enhanced Web Application Security Audit SaaS Built on ZAP

Document Overview
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the requirements, features, and specifications for developing a SaaS platform that provides AI-enhanced security audit checks for web applications, particularly those coded with AI assistance or "vibe-coded" apps. Vibe coded  apps  are apps that are primarily created by non-developers using AI tools and agents. The platform will be built on top of the open-source Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) tool, leveraging its API for scanning capabilities and integrating artificial intelligence (AI) for enhanced vulnerability detection and reporting. The target audience includes developers, businesses, and non-technical users seeking to secure their web applications.

1. Product Vision

Objective: Create a user-friendly, scalable SaaS platform that automates security audits for web applications, focusing on detecting vulnerabilities in AI-coded or dynamically generated web apps. By leveraging ZAP’s robust scanning capabilities and AI for adaptive testing and reporting, the platform will deliver comprehensive, actionable security insights to ensure web application safety.

Mission: Empower users to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in their web applications quickly and efficiently, with a focus on AI-generated code, through an intuitive interface and intelligent, AI-driven analysis.
Value Proposition: 
•	Comprehensive vulnerability detection tailored for AI-coded web apps. 
•	User-friendly interface for non-technical users. 
•	Detailed, AI-generated reports with actionable recommendations. 
•	Cost-effective, scalable solution built on open-source ZAP technology.

2. Target Audience
•	Primary Users: 
o	Developers and DevOps teams building or maintaining web applications, especially those using AI tools like Cursor for coding. 
o	Businesses seeking to secure their web properties without extensive technical expertise.
•	Secondary Users: 
o	Non-technical stakeholders (e.g., CTOs, product managers) needing high-level security insights and reports.
•	Use Cases: 
o	Regular security audits for web applications. 
o	Pre-launch testing for AI-coded or dynamically generated apps. 
o	Ongoing monitoring to comply with security standards (e.g., OWASP Top 10).

3. Key Features
The SaaS will include the following core features, leveraging ZAP’s API and AI enhancements:
3.1. User Interface
•	Web-Based Dashboard: A clean, intuitive interface for users to: 
o	Input website URLs for scanning. 
o	View scan status, history, and reports. 
o	Manage subscriptions and settings.
•	Accessibility: Ensure compatibility with desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and mobile responsiveness for monitoring. 
•	Onboarding: Guided walkthrough for first-time users to input URLs and configure scans.
3.2. AI-Enhanced Scanning
•	URL Input: Users enter a website URL, and the platform crawls and scans it using ZAP’s Spider and Active Scan APIs, enhanced by AI for: 
o	Adaptive navigation to discover all pages, forms, and inputs. 
o	Context-specific test input generation (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) tailored to AI-coded app vulnerabilities.
•	Selenium Integration: Simulate user interactions (e.g., form submissions, button clicks) using ZAP’s Browser Automation capabilities, controlled by AI for dynamic sites. 
•	Vulnerability Detection: Identify common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF) and AI-specific issues (e.g., inadequate input validation, hardcoded credentials). 
•	Rate Limiting: Prevent overloading target sites, ensuring ethical and non-destructive scanning.
3.3. Reporting
•	Detailed Reports: Generate PDF and web-based reports including: 
o	List of vulnerabilities with severity (high, medium, low). 
o	Evidence (e.g., screenshots, response snippets). 
o	AI-generated recommendations for mitigation (e.g., “Use prepared statements for SQL injection”).
•	Export Options: Allow exporting reports in PDF, CSV, or JSON formats. 
•	Customizable Alerts: Notify users via email or dashboard when critical vulnerabilities are found.
3.4. Scalability and Performance
•	Queue System: Handle multiple concurrent scans efficiently using a queue, leveraging cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, GCP). 
•	Performance Monitoring: Track scan times and resource usage to optimize for large-scale operations.
3.5. Security and Compliance
•	Legal Compliance: Require users to confirm authorization to scan their sites, preventing unauthorized access or legal issues. 
•	Data Privacy: Ensure scan data is anonymized and stored securely, complying with GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations. 
•	Non-Destructive Testing: Focus on detection, not exploitation, to avoid damaging target sites.
3.6. Continuous Improvement (Optional)
•	Feedback Loop: Allow users to opt-in to share anonymized scan data, improving AI models over time. 
•	Regular Updates: Update ZAP and AI models quarterly to address new vulnerabilities and improve accuracy.
