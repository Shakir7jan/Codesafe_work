3. Key Features
The SaaS will include the following core features, leveraging ZAP’s API and AI enhancements:
3.1. User Interface
•	Web-Based Dashboard: A clean, intuitive interface for users to: 
o	Input website URLs for scanning. 
o	View scan status, history, and reports. 
o	Manage subscriptions and settings.
•	Accessibility: Ensure compatibility with desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and mobile responsiveness for monitoring. 
•	Onboarding: Guided walkthrough for first-time users to input URLs and configure scans.
3.2. AI-Enhanced Scanning
•	URL Input: Users enter a website URL, and the platform crawls and scans it using ZAP’s Spider and Active Scan APIs, enhanced by AI for: 
o	Adaptive navigation to discover all pages, forms, and inputs. 
o	Context-specific test input generation (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) tailored to AI-coded app vulnerabilities.
•	Selenium Integration: Simulate user interactions (e.g., form submissions, button clicks) using ZAP’s Browser Automation capabilities, controlled by AI for dynamic sites. 
•	Vulnerability Detection: Identify common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF) and AI-specific issues (e.g., inadequate input validation, hardcoded credentials). 
•	Rate Limiting: Prevent overloading target sites, ensuring ethical and non-destructive scanning.
3.3. Reporting
•	Detailed Reports: Generate PDF and web-based reports including: 
o	List of vulnerabilities with severity (high, medium, low). 
o	Evidence (e.g., screenshots, response snippets). 
o	AI-generated recommendations for mitigation (e.g., “Use prepared statements for SQL injection”).
•	Export Options: Allow exporting reports in PDF, CSV, or JSON formats. 
•	Customizable Alerts: Notify users via email or dashboard when critical vulnerabilities are found.
3.4. Security and Compliance
•	Legal Compliance: Require users to confirm authorization to scan their sites, preventing unauthorized access or legal issues. 
•	Data Privacy: Ensure scan data is anonymized and stored securely, complying with GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations. 
•	Non-Destructive Testing: Focus on detection, not exploitation, to avoid damaging target sites.
